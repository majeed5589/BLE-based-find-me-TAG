ESP32 BLE Deep Sleep Device Finder

An ESP32-based BLE device that goes into deep sleep to conserve power, wakes up periodically to advertise itself, and responds to commands sent from a mobile app (e.g., NRF Connect) to locate items by turning on an LED. This project is ideal for low-power applications where the ESP32 is attached to objects like remotes, books, or other items to assist in finding them via Bluetooth Low Energy.

ðŸ’¡ Command Handling: Responds to a "find" command by turning on the built-in LED.
ðŸ•’ Configurable Wake-Up Time: Easily set the deep sleep interval to balance power consumption and responsiveness.
ðŸ”§ Customizable Device Name: Change the advertised name to match your item's identity (e.g., "book_pad", "game_controller").
